sftpLinuxNotFound=If on Linux, you'll need to take an extra step to get SFTP working and install the "putty-tools" package.  For example, on Ubuntu, do the following:\n\n 1. Go to System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager.\n 2. Then in Settings->Repositories->Ubuntu Software and make sure "Community-maintained Open Source software (universe)" is checked.\n 3. Close the dialog and then find the "putty-tools" package.\n 4. Put a checkmark next to it.\n 5. Hit Apply in the main toolbar.\n 6. Voila!
sftpMacNotFound=For Mac OS X, you'll need to take an extra step and install the "putty" package.  Honestly, it's a huge install (1 GB+) which will take about half an hour to do (or more if you need to download Xcode).  Unfortunately, there isn't an easier way to do this on a Mac.  Anyway, here are the steps to follow:\n\n 1. Install the Xcode 3.0 Developer Tools found on your Apple's Install Disc in the "Optional Installs" folder (Optional Installs->Xcode Tools->XcodeTools.mpkg) or at https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/getSoftware?bundleID=19897  (beware: it's a 1 GB download)\n 2. Then you need to install MacPorts: http://www.macports.org/install.php\n 3. Open up a Terminal (Applications->Utilities->Terminal)\n 4. At the prompt type: sudo port install putty\n 5. (you may be asked for a password)\n 6. Voila!
